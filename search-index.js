For example, in an image tagged with the name `my-app:3.1.4`, `my-app` is the Repository component of the name.

If a hostname is present, it may optionally be followed by a port number in the format `:8080`. Name components may contain lowercase characters, digits, and separators.

A name component may not start or end with a separator.",0,null],[12,"tag","","A tag serves to map a descriptive, user-given name to any single image ID.
